      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm David. I'm a software engineer and Naval Nuclear Power Program veteran. In the Navy I was responsible for the day to day operations of three teams totaling 30 people. Our responsibilities included complete chemistry and radiological control of two A4W nuclear reactors, as well as the radiation safety and health monitoring of over 1,000 sailors. I learned a lot from that experience but I found that my true passion is learning and problem solving. I want to take that passion and use it to help understand the world around us and to create innovative solutions for the problems it's facing. When I found coding I realized that is a real possibility, and opportunities are everywhere. Outside of that I love spending my free time outdoors, so when I'm not coding you can find me rock climbing, hiking, or doing outdoor photography. Currently I am looking for opportunities to learn from others, contribute to meaningful work, and continue to grow my skill set.",
